# Contabilize
  Hello!
  
  Given the challenges for developing an application, being able to develop the following application attached on this page.
Based on my little knowledge in development, I was able to develop only those features.
  
  The application is called Contabilize, and aims to carry out the balance sheet of a company, with entries and exits.
  OBS: I can't develop a node in JavaScript or TypeScript, so I'm sending as far as I was able to develop and another BackEnd in SpringBoot without JWT to do the tests in FrontEnd.
